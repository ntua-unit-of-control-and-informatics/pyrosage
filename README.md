# Pyrosage - Environmental Property Predictors

This repository contains datasets, models, and reproducible notebooks for predicting key physicochemical, environmental, and toxicity-related properties of chemical compounds. These predictors are intended to support virtual screening and safer chemical design, especially for applications like flame retardancy and environmental safety.

## ‚úÖ Covered Properties

The following properties are included and modeled using open datasets:

- LogKow / LogP
- Bioaccumulation Factor (BCF)
- Soil/Water Partition Coefficient (Koc)
- Biodegradability
- Water Solubility
- Henry's Law Constant (KH)
- Aqueous Hydroxyl Rate (kAOH)
- Hydrolytic Stability
- pKa (acidic and basic)
- KOA (Octanol-Air Partition Coefficient)
- TBP (related to biodegradation)
- Fish Bioaccumulation / Toxicity
- Molecular Weight (computed)

Some of the datasets and models in this repository are reused or adapted from the work of Wang et al. (2023), titled *"Applicability Domains Based on Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning Enable Graph Attention Network Models to Accurately Predict 15 Environmental End Points"*. This study introduced GAT-based QSAR models with applicability domain refinements for environmental property prediction.
